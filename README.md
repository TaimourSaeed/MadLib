# MadLib

My attempt at a MadLib with some extras, if you dont know what a MadLib is, it's just a fun way to describe taking random string from an input and doing some string concatenation to made up a crazy story aka MadLib.

# What I Learned

* String cocatenation using f-strings
* Create a loop using the while loop function
* expirmented with input validation
