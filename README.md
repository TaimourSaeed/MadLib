# MadLib

My attempt at a MadLib with some extras, if you dont know what a MadLib is, it's just a fun way to describe taking random string from an input and doing some string concatenation to made up a crazy story aka MadLib.

# What I Learned

* String cocatenation using f-strings.
* Created a loop using the while function to allow the user to repeat the script to their hearts content.
* expirmented with input validation.
